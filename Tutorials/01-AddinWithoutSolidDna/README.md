# Creating a SolidWorks add-in without SolidDNA

This project creates a blank add-in without SolidDNA, so with the raw SolidWorks API. You can register this add-in in SolidWorks using regasm or using our [Add-in Installer](https://github.com/CAD-Booster/SolidDNA/tree/master/Tools).

This tutorial exists mostly to show you all the things you no longer have to worry about when you use SolidDNA. If you want to start using SolidDNA, check out tutorial 02.
