# Creating a SolidWorks add-in with SolidDNA, WPF and task pane 

This project creates a SolidWorks add-in using SolidDNA and adds a basic WPF task pane control as the main UI. It shows you how to create an add-in and a plugin class, add a GUID, register into SolidWorks and build a basic task pane. The task pane has a single button that does nothing.
