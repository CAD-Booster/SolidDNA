# Edit custom properties with SolidDNA

This project shows how to read and write custom properties in a SolidWorks model using an add-in. The add-in is built using SolidDNA and contains a SolidWorks task pane built using WPF.

All work is done in the code-behind of the xaml file to keep things simple. This is not ideal, you should learn how to use MVVM and data binding to separate the UI from the data logic.
