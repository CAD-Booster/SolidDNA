# SolidDNA stand-alone console application

This project shows how easy it is to use SolidDNA from a stand-alone console application that is not integrated into SolidWorks as an add-in. This allows you to quickly run and test code while keeping SolidWorks running.

Start up SolidWorks, then run this project. It will connect to the active SolidWorks instance and then you have access to all of the SolidDNA API.
